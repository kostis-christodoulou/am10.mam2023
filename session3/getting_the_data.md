the data for London houses and EPC certificates is large and cannot be uploaded on github/Canvas

Please download the following files and save them in the data folder. You will need to unzip/extract them if you want to use them. 
Unfortunately, Tableau cannot read and extract a zipped file, so you will have to unzip/extract the file locally to make sure you can read it.
